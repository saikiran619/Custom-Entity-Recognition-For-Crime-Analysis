ABOUT THE PROJECT:

This Project is based on CRIME DOMAIN as it is helpful in identifying certain key items related to the CRIME DEPARTMENT.
For example, the reports which are present in crime departments are in the format of hard copy so if they want any clue related to the investigation they look after the previous cases registered so each an every time they look into the documents of FIR or any other documentation.
So this project will be useful in identifying key items like SUSPECT,VICTIM,PERSON NAME and many other items related to the crime.
So the input will be in the form of crime statement (sequence of characters), my project will identify the entities present in statement of sentence.
